        Brett and Brent met at Plymouth State University during Brent's
        sophomore and Brett's freshman years, where they both lived in the Mary
        Lyon dormitory. They began dating on Brent's birthday, November 7th, in
        2012 and the rest is history!
      </p>
      <p>
        Through the years Brent and Brett have worked to always keep things fun
        and strive to become better versions of themselves together and apart.
      </p>
      <p>
        They have enjoyed many adventures together. The summer of 2016 Brent and
        Brett went on a 7-week road trip across the country. More recently, they
        have been trying to hike all 48 of New Hampshire's 4000 foot mountains.{" "}

        In June 2021 Brent and Brett bought a home together in Franklin, NH.
        They now enjoy slowly but surely updating their home, and hosting small
        board game nights and cook outs.

        On December 4th of this past year, while hiking Piper Mountain, Brent
        asked Brett to marry him!
      </p>
      <p>
        Brett chose to make the engagement a quick affair. Having had their
        anniversary on Brent's birthday the last 9 years, it felt only fitting
        to have their new date be something similar. And what better day than
        Brett's half-birthday two weeks later?!
